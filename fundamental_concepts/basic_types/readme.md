# A Brief Explanation of Data Types
Just like most languages we speak and write, there are different ways to describe the things we talk about and in a computer's case, the data we talk about. In spoken language, `1, 2, 3, 4, 5` aren’t regular words, they’re numbers. And `red, blue, green, orange` are colors. Computers also categorize data in a similar way by describing the type of information they hold, known as `Data Types`.
