# HOW TO PROGRAM FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER PROGRAMMED BEFORE
This is an incomprehensive guide for people who've never programmed on how to get started programming in any language. This guide is written by a monkey who can computer, so everything will be explained as simply as possible.

## What you need to know
The following are the concepts one should learn **in order**, as each concept builds off the previous, at minimum in order program a computer. One should think of these not as things one needs in order to write code in a specific language, but rather as tools one needs under their belt in order to solve problems.

### Fundamental Concepts
1. Understand what **Input** and **Output** are
2. Understand **IF** *this* **THEN** *that* concept
3. Understand what **Variables** are
